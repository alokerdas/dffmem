# dffmem
Memories made with flip-flops

DFF memories are easy to code. But takes a lot of space when manufactured. But it is great from performance point of view when used as internal RAM, boot RAM , cache. Close to processor but small in size. This IP is designed to be used for my cpu. They are taped out on GF-180 nm technology. They are avilable for integration with any other IPs.
